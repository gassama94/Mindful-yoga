## Visual Design

### Fonts
*  The primary font, Montserrat was chosen because it is standard, plain and informative but not too rigid. It looks friendly and conversational but holds a seriousness. It is also sans-serif, making it very easily readable throughout different color schemes and complementary to the font used for Headings.
* The secondary font, Julius Sans One was chosen because it is thin, elegant and refined yet it has flair. As a font, it gave me the impression of an art gallery. It is sans-serif, so it is clear, clean and simple, maintaining the idea of a minimalist aesthetic. It was chosen for headings as it is evident but doesn't distract, keeping the eyes more focused on the photography.

### Icons

* Icons are taken from  the [ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons Icon) library.
* They can easily be styled using other classes.
* Icons are utilised in the footer for social account icons and the form on the Contact page.


### Colors
* I wanted the site to maintain a minimal aesthetic, colors are very basic and clean for highlighting the photos.
* The primary color used is black. This is used to create a stark contrast with the background, drawing the eyes and focus on them. This removes distraction. White is used as the bakground color has more to do with lighting and reflection. On most computer screens, wherein the light is emitted from the screen.
* One accent color was chosen, the red to give a life connection to nature and training, the outdoors and travel.
* Text is primarily written in grey and black.
* Finally, a neutral grey color is used for the footer to set it apart from the other elements on the site.
