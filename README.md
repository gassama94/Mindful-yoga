## Visual Design

### Fonts

*  The primary font, Montserrat was chosen because it is standard, plain and informative but not too rigid. It looks friendly and conversational but holds a seriousness. It is also sans-serif, making it very easily readable throughout different color schemes and complementary to the font used for Headings.
* The secondary font is sans-serif, so it is clear, clean and simple, maintaining the idea of a minimalist aesthetic.
<br>

### Icons
<br> 

   <img src="assets/images/icons.png" alt="">

### Colors
<br> 
 
<img src="assets/images/Palletes.png" alt="">

* I wanted the site to maintain a minimal aesthetic, colors are very basic and clean for highlighting the photos.
* The primary color used is gray . This is used to create a stark contrast with the background, drawing the eyes and focus on them. This removes distraction. White is used as the bakground color has more to do with lighting and reflection. On most computer screens, wherein the light is emitted from the screen.
* One accent color was chosen, the  red to give a life connection to nature and training, the outdoors and travel.
* Text is primarily written in grey and headings in black and red.
* A neutral red color is used for the footer to set it apart from the other elements on the site and used for hover on links and buttons. 
<br>


### Styling

* links on each pages are re-used to direct the user to either the  contact page, program page, about page or home page no matter where they look.
* CSS flex box model has been used through out the website.

# Features

## Flexbox
Flexbox is a layout system that lets you create flexible and responsive designs with ease. With Flexbox, you can align and space items along a single axis or both axes at once.

Some cool things you can do with Flexbox include:

* Adjust the size of items based on their content or using percentages or other units.
* Align items horizontally or vertically, and distribute them evenly or with specific spacing.
* Change the order of items within a container without changing the HTML.
* Create layouts that work well on different screen sizes and devices.
To get started with Flexbox, check out some online resources like [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) on CSS-Tricks or [Flexbox Froggy.](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) You can also experiment on your own by creating a simple HTML/CSS layout and using Flexbox properties to adjust the positioning and sizing of your elements. Good luck!

* Next, I added my website files to my Git repository using Git commands like git add and git commit.

* Finally, I enabled GitHub Pages for my repository by going to the "Settings" tab on my repository page, scrolling down to the "GitHub Pages" section, and selecting "Branch: website" under "Source".

That's it! Now my yoga website is deployed on GitHub and accessible to anyone at https://[username].github.io/yoga-website. With Gitpod, the entire process was made much easier and streamlined.
